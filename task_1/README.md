## Task 1
## Beginner Level 
## Name of Project : Iris Flowers Classification ML Project
## Project Description : This particular ML project is usually referred to as the “Hello World” of Machine Learning. The iris flowers dataset contains numeric attributes, and it is perfect for beginners to learn about supervised ML algorithms, mainly how to load and handle data. Also, since this is a small dataset, it can easily fit in memory without requiring special transformations or scaling capabilities.

## About Dataset 
- The data set contains 3 classes with 50 instances each, and 150 instances in total, where each class refers to a type of iris plant.

- Class : Iris Setosa,Iris Versicolour, Iris Virginica

- Format for the data: (sepal_length, sepal_width, petal_length, petal_width)

## Machine Learning Algorithm Used :
- Supervised Learning (KNN Algorithm, Decision Tree)
- Unsupervised Learning (K Mean Clustering)
